                </li>
                <li>1 envelope Fleischmann's® Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise Yeast 
                </li>
<li>¾ teaspoon salt 
</li>
<li>⅔ cup water 
</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil
</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Toppings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces sausage, cooked and crumbled 
                </li>
                <li>1 cup frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed 
                </li>
<li> ¼ cup chopped onion
</li>
<li>3 large eggs
</li>
<li>½ teaspoon Durkee® Ground Mustard 
</li>
<li>½ teaspoon Durkee® Fine Grind Black Pepper 
</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt 
</li>
<li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>                Step 1: Combine 1 cup flour, undissolved yeast and salt in a large bowl. Heat water and oil until very warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees F). Add to flour mixture and beat for 2 minutes. Add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest at this point for 10 minutes.)
                </li>
                <li>Step 2: Roll dough to 12-inch circle; place in greased pizza pan. OR, pat dough with floured hands, pressing gently to fill greased pizza pan or baking sheet. Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough; prick surface with fork.
                </li>
<li>Step 3: Bake crust in preheated 450 degrees F oven on lowest oven rack for 8 minutes. Reduce oven to 375 degrees F. Remove pizza from oven.
</li>
<li>
Step 4: Top pizza crust with sausage, hash browns and onions. Beat eggs, ground mustard, pepper and salt together in a bowl. Pour over toppings. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 16 to 20 minutes until eggs are set and crust is browned.
